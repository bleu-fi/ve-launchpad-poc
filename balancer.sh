# Workaround for Balancer's own pkg naming convention and foundry.toml @balancer-labs/ remapping.
# That is also why we have to link their packages to node_modules in package.json
# and create some issues during verification (although this could also be related to some other
# inconsistensy/bug in the way we setup stuff or in foundry's build/verify). 
# Ideally we'd be able to override the remapping in foundry.toml, but that doesn't seem to be possible.
